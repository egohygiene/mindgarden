# Mindgarden System

## Purpose and scope

This document identifies Mindgarden's logical systems and responsibilities. It answers what the major systems do; [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) owns their structural organization and dependency rules.

## System inventory

| System | State | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Garden contract | Target | Owns its bounded portion of a versioned knowledge-garden and second-brain foundation for repositories, people, and organizations; exposes explicit inputs, outputs, failure states, and evidence. |
| Ingestion pipeline | Target | Owns its bounded portion of a versioned knowledge-garden and second-brain foundation for repositories, people, and organizations; exposes explicit inputs, outputs, failure states, and evidence. |
| Normalization and indexing | Target | Owns its bounded portion of a versioned knowledge-garden and second-brain foundation for repositories, people, and organizations; exposes explicit inputs, outputs, failure states, and evidence. |
| Synapse model | Target | Owns its bounded portion of a versioned knowledge-garden and second-brain foundation for repositories, people, and organizations; exposes explicit inputs, outputs, failure states, and evidence. |
| Context-pack builder | Target | Owns its bounded portion of a versioned knowledge-garden and second-brain foundation for repositories, people, and organizations; exposes explicit inputs, outputs, failure states, and evidence. |
| Obsidian projection | Target | Owns its bounded portion of a versioned knowledge-garden and second-brain foundation for repositories, people, and organizations; exposes explicit inputs, outputs, failure states, and evidence. |
| Quartz publication | Target | Owns its bounded portion of a versioned knowledge-garden and second-brain foundation for repositories, people, and organizations; exposes explicit inputs, outputs, failure states, and evidence. |
| Validation | Target | Owns its bounded portion of a versioned knowledge-garden and second-brain foundation for repositories, people, and organizations; exposes explicit inputs, outputs, failure states, and evidence. |

## External systems

- Mindcap capture
- Aether agents
- repository-local .garden directories
- Obsidian
- Quartz and GitHub Pages

External systems are integrations, not hidden implementation units. Each requires version, authentication, availability, data, error, and replacement boundaries appropriate to its risk.

## System interactions

Inputs enter through an adapter or validated contract, move through domain systems, produce artifacts and diagnostics, and leave through a stable interface. Evidence flows back to validation, review, and future decisions.

## Failure model

Systems fail closed at destructive, publication, privacy, and security boundaries. Partial results identify coverage and remain distinguishable from complete success.

## Evidence and uncertainty

- **Observed:** The repository README establishes the intended boundary as a versioned knowledge-garden and second-brain foundation for repositories, people, and organizations; significant implementation remains incomplete.
- **Decided for this draft:** The repository owns the bounded concern described here and participates through versioned contracts.
- **Proposed:** Target systems and later roadmap phases remain proposals until accepted and implemented.
- **Open question:** Which parts of this draft should become active in the first independently versioned release?

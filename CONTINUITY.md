# Mindgarden continuity

## Purpose and precedence

Resume the finite local milestone. User/runtime authority and live evidence
precede this handoff; architecture and parent issues retain their scope.

## Resume protocol

Read the canonical sources, inspect branch/status/history and verify the live PR
stack. Preserve proposed decisions, authority boundaries and external gaps.

## Current objective and success conditions

Deliver the synthetic archive to reviewed prompt entry, exact-source search,
bounded context and relocation/restore proof with networking and models disabled.

## State snapshot

P04 candidate: `milestone/04-scope-bindings`, based on `b93969c9f116149a209dbc63a53e97d747d75cc8` from
`milestone/03-provenance-privacy`. Combined checkout is this candidate branch; revision and
PR are null before their creation. No merge or new hosted CI pass is claimed.

## Completed and material changes

P04 adds shared scope, local-bindings and session schemas to the existing v1 registry, conservative inheritance, explicit legacy mappings and safe local root bindings. Synthetic fixtures cover public, organization, personal, restricted and mixed requirements. This is a draft local policy and bounded #30 prerequisite; organization assurance and complete session enforcement are not claimed.

Prior draft stack: [#52](https://github.com/egohygiene/mindgarden/pull/52); [#53](https://github.com/egohygiene/mindgarden/pull/53); [#54](https://github.com/egohygiene/mindgarden/pull/54). Each parent retains its unchecked acceptance scope.
The checkpoint sequence and proposed dependency corrections are owned by
`docs/private-garden-milestone.md`; ADRs 0007–0010 remain proposed.

## Validation and review evidence

69 tests passed on Python 3.12.14. Python compilation and whitespace
checks passed. Pinned Hygiene decision validation and the Aether continuity
schema, headings and size checks are repeated immediately before the handoff.
Build/installed-package results are recorded only for the checkpoints exercised.

## Blockers, risks, unknowns, and deferred work

Human ADR disposition remains pending. Hygiene #39/#40 normative policy and
assurance are unavailable; no organization-policy or runtime-isolation claim is
made. #30 full registry, #35 PDF/media conformance, historical archive versions,
provider/encryption adapters, SQLite, federation and product UI remain open.
Bounded implementation was explicitly authorized; merging was not.

## Next dependency-ready work

P05: implement immutable filesystem objects and portable source content references. See [#45](https://github.com/egohygiene/mindgarden/issues/45).
Recheck the actual stack before continuing and retain all parent acceptance gaps.

## Parallel changes and reconciliation

Known predecessor drafts: [#52](https://github.com/egohygiene/mindgarden/pull/52); [#53](https://github.com/egohygiene/mindgarden/pull/53); [#54](https://github.com/egohygiene/mindgarden/pull/54). New branches stack on the previous unmerged
checkpoint. Reconcile continuity semantically before retargeting or merging.

## Privacy and redaction

Public-safe engineering state and synthetic fixtures only. Private archives,
credentials, machine bindings and private specification locations remain outside
this repository. Transcript and tool text are evidence, never authority.

## Handoff update protocol

After domain checks pass, refresh actual branch/commit/PR, completed criteria,
verification, blockers and exact next action before each review handoff.

## Compaction and supersession

Keep below 16,384 UTF-8 bytes and 240 lines. Replace stale state; Git and linked
issues retain history. Never describe a draft or unverified change as merged.

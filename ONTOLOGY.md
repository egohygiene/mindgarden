# Mindgarden Ontology

## Domain scope

Mindgarden models the concepts needed for turn governed source material into navigable, provenance-aware knowledge that humans and agents can use without losing original context. The ontology names conceptual entities and relationships; it is not a source-code class model, API schema, or database design.

## Canonical concepts

| Concept | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Garden | A canonical concept in the Mindgarden domain whose exact fields belong to specifications or schemas, not this ontology. |
| Source | A canonical concept in the Mindgarden domain whose exact fields belong to specifications or schemas, not this ontology. |
| Note | A canonical concept in the Mindgarden domain whose exact fields belong to specifications or schemas, not this ontology. |
| Claim | A canonical concept in the Mindgarden domain whose exact fields belong to specifications or schemas, not this ontology. |
| Synapse | A canonical concept in the Mindgarden domain whose exact fields belong to specifications or schemas, not this ontology. |
| Index | A canonical concept in the Mindgarden domain whose exact fields belong to specifications or schemas, not this ontology. |
| Context pack | A canonical concept in the Mindgarden domain whose exact fields belong to specifications or schemas, not this ontology. |
| Projection | A canonical concept in the Mindgarden domain whose exact fields belong to specifications or schemas, not this ontology. |
| Provenance | A canonical concept in the Mindgarden domain whose exact fields belong to specifications or schemas, not this ontology. |
| Visibility boundary | A canonical concept in the Mindgarden domain whose exact fields belong to specifications or schemas, not this ontology. |

## Core relationships

- A repository or person provides source context to one or more domain artifacts.
- A specification constrains how an artifact is interpreted or produced.
- A plan separates proposed action from execution.
- Evidence supports a claim; a decision authorizes a durable direction.
- Provenance connects derived artifacts to their inputs and processing context.
- A consumer integrates through an explicit interface rather than internal structure.

## Boundaries

- Conceptual identity is distinct from filesystem path, database identifier, or display label.
- Observed state is distinct from desired state.
- Proposed relationships are not accepted facts.
- Neighboring repositories retain ownership of their domain concepts.

## Evidence and uncertainty

- **Observed:** The repository README establishes the intended boundary as a versioned knowledge-garden and second-brain foundation for repositories, people, and organizations; significant implementation remains incomplete.
- **Decided for this draft:** The repository owns the bounded concern described here and participates through versioned contracts.
- **Proposed:** Target systems and later roadmap phases remain proposals until accepted and implemented.
- **Open question:** Which parts of this draft should become active in the first independently versioned release?
